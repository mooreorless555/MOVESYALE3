# MOVESYALE
*(reuploaded)*

Same Moves app, new repo! Chris and Sam diverged too much on their own without making commits, had an issue with FB authentication and therefore Chris used what was on the Git and manually fixed all merges as well as overhauled the code structure.

If you're collabing with us and want to get up and running, make sure you've already installed cordova and ionic.

Download this repo and then hit up Sam's repo for the backend: https://github.com/smbddha/moves_backend

Put his repo in a folder called "backend" inside this repo and in your terminal window, cd to the backend folder and run
```
npm install
```
then you should be all set.

You will also need a good deal of native plugins for your app to build properly which I will list here later.
